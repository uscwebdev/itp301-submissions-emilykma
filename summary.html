        <h1>Project Summary</h1>

        <h3>Topic/Purpose</h3>
        <p>I have created a single-page website featuring 6 different playlists resembling current playlists within my personal apple music app. Each of these playlists encaptures a different vibe and feeling of music, yet each song displayed has been a key component in making my junior year thus far. Each of these sounds have had immense impact on me and my purpose was to share these hits with users. I hope people are able to get new song recommendations from my suggestions.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>The title of each playlist is listed in a sub-heading at the top of my page in pink. Users can click on each of these subheadings, bringing them to the start of that playlist within the page. If users click on the title of each playlist, they will find a pop-up providing them more information about the vibe and theme captured within each playlist, as each one varies. Users can click on each '+' sign to add their favorite songs to the corresponding playlist, by providing information about the song in an input form. When clicking the 'x' button under each song, users can remove songs they do not like from the respective playlist.</p>

        <h3>Extras</h3>
        The first extra I used was a React Library, which is a pop-up that occurs when users click on the heading of each playlist. The second is event-driven DOM manipulation, as I allow users to add and remove DOM nodes. To do so, they can click on the + button and provide information in an input-form. When clicking "save song", the page will update to save the user's suggested song according to their provided information and add this song to the respective playlist. Users can also remove songs by simply clicking each 'x' button, removing the song from the playlist.
